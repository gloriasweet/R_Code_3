The beauty of rCharts is its ability to harness the 
ingenuity from the entire ecosystem inside and outside of r. 
Whole libraries, such as dimplejs, nvd3, rickshaw, highcharts, 
morris, and polycharts, or even specific custom visualizations 
can quickly be incorporated into your workflow and publishing. 
If desired, these can be delivered in various reproducible formats with slidify. 
I strongly encourage you to check out rCharts, slidify, and dimplejs. 
They have changed my world.
